# Pythagoras-Theorem-es-

Command based python program to determine, through the use of Pythagoras theorem, the missing value of a triangle rectangle.
By Andres van den Bos 2020

User is first prompted to write down which part of the triangle rectangle is missing (cathetus1, cathetus2 or hypotenuse). Once the part with the unknown value is established, the user is then prompted again to give values for the known parts.

The program is made in a way in which you will always get an answer, if user inputs a negative value, or inputs a cathetus value higher than the hypotenuse, the program will output an especific "error" message.

If all the given values are correct, the program will then find the value of the missing part by using the Pythagoras Theorem.
